The project I really want to make with this class is a program that would help me at work. ÊI would do a data dump from our system into a CSV file. ÊMy Java program would go through the lines and using different algorithms, the program would output which inventory items to order and how much. ÊI can pick which columns to output out of our system so I believe I could make this as complex as needed. ÊI would like to add a GUI and maybe some user settings as well.
